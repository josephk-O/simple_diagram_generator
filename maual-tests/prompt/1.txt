Draw a detailed **system monitoring architecture** with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Alertmanager**. Place Prometheus at the center scraping metrics from **Node Exporters**, **App Exporters**, **DB Exporters**, and a **Blackbox Exporter**. Connect Grafana to Prometheus for dashboards and optionally to **Loki** (logs) and **Tempo/Jaeger** (traces). Show Prometheus sending alerts to Alertmanager, which routes notifications to **Slack**, **Email**, and **PagerDuty**. Group components into layers: *Application Layer* (apps, DB, exporters), *Monitoring Layer* (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, Tempo), and *Notification Layer* (alert channels). Use labeled boxes and arrows to show metric, alert, and log flows. Optionally include **Ingress/Reverse Proxy**, **OAuth2/SSO**, and **Cloud Storage** (S3/Thanos) for long-term metrics.
